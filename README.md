LuckyBlocks
=============

Simple lucky block plugin and tutorial.

What is it?
=============

LuckyBlocks is a Minecraft Mod(Modification) which allows users to have a random chance of getting a very lucky item or something
that might flat out screw you over but who cares, right? There is suppose to be 3 types of blocks but you should be able to
do that part yourself

This includes:
* Random Drops
* Chance to get the Lucky Sword
* Most likely gonna be updated on request :P
